    <h1>A Friendship Proposal</h1>
    <p>
    Great!, seems like you are here, so, Hi Amritha ðŸ˜Š<br><br>
    If youâ€™re reading this, it means I succeeded in pulling off this ridiculous social stunt.<br><br>
    First, let me explain why Iâ€™m doing this.<br><br>
    I need your help â€” yes, your help.<br> 
    So basically, Iâ€™d love for you to play the presenter role in my team, in all the future hackathons that I participate in.<br><br>
    Why you? Well, you are a confident speaker, no stage-fear, not socially awkward, etc,
    unlike me who would rather skydive with no parachutes on than deliver a speech in front of 3 people.<br>
    And if I remember correctly, youâ€™re also a STATE-LEVEL DEBATER!<br>
    (you mentioned that while we were in the same classroom during the pre-onboarding sessions)<br><br>
    And why ask you this through a QR code instead of just asking directly?<br>
    Because Iâ€™ve been trying to talk to you for over 30 days, but somehow
    I always chose to remain silent at the very last moment for reasons logic cannot explain.<br>
    Even yesterday, I was waiting for you, to talk to you, but... NeVeRmiND, let me get to the point.<br><br>
    So now, I request you to answer the following question<br>
    Do you wish to be my hackathon teammate?
