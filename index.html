    But since you're already here, hi Amritha.<br><br>
    If youâ€™re reading this, it means I succeeded in pulling off this ridiculous social stunt.<br><br>
    So let me explain why Iâ€™m doing this.<br><br>
    I need your help â€” yes, your help. Iâ€™d love for you to be the presenter in the future hackathons I participate in.<br><br>
    Why you? Well, if I remember correctly, youâ€™re a STATE-LEVEL DEBATER!<br><br>
    (you mentioned that while we were in the same classroom during the pre-onboarding sessions)<br><br>
    And why ask you this through a QR code instead of just asking directly?<br><br>

    <div class="choices">
      <div class="option">
        <p>Anbe shivam dude! Say yes ðŸ˜‚</p>
        <button onclick="choose('yes')">YES!</button>
      </div>
      <div class="option">
        <p>No kindness? Fine...</p>
        <button onclick="choose('yes2')">YES, but I need more info</button>
      </div>
    </div>
