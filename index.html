    <h1>A Friendship Proposal</h1>
    <p>First of all, don't scan random QR codes</p>
    <p>
    But since you're already here, hi Amritha!.<br><br>
    If youâ€™re reading this, it means I succeeded in pulling off this ridiculous social stunt.<br><br>
    So let me explain why Iâ€™m doing this.<br><br>
    I need your help â€” yes, your help. Iâ€™d love for you to be the presenter in the future hackathons that I participate in.<br><br>
    Why you? Well, you are a confident speaker, no stage-fear, not socially awkward, etc,
    unlike me who would rather skydive with no parachutes on than go directly ask help from a person.<br>
    and if I remember correctly, youâ€™re also a STATE-LEVEL DEBATER!<br>
    (you mentioned that while we were in the same classroom during the pre-onboarding sessions)<br><br>
    And why ask you this through a QR code instead of just asking directly?<br><br>
    Because Iâ€™ve been trying to talk to you for over 30 days, but somehow I always backed off for reasons logic cannot explain.<br><br>
    So here we are,<br>
    Now I request you to answer the following question<br>
    Do you wish to be my hackathon teammate?
